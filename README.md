Twitter Stream Bundle
=============

A Symfony bundle that connects you to Twitters stream API, currently only supporting **statuses/filter** (see https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter)

Twitter Stream Bundle simply:

  - Connects to Twitters streaming API
  - Recieves any data which matches your `track` keywords.
  - Triggers an event when a new Tweet is received

 

Version
----

0.1 - Initial Release

Installation
--------------

Add TwitterStreamBundle to your composer.json:

```
{
    "require": {
        "scripter-co/twitter-stream-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Get composer to fetch the package for you:

```
php composer.phar update scripter-co/twitter-stream-bundle
```

Usage
-----

Craete a `command` under your bundle (e.g. `CoreBundle\Command\TwitterStreamCommand.php`) and place the :

```
$twitter_request_service = $this->container->get('scripterco_twitter_stream.request');
$twitter_request_service->setConsumerKey('KEY')
                        ->setConsumerSecret('SECRET')
                        ->setToken('TOKEN')
                        ->setTokenSecret('SECRET')
                        ->setKeywords(array(
                            'my_keyword'
                        ))
                        ->start();
```

When a tweet is found with your `my_keyword` keyword, it will trigger an event (`scripterco_twitter_stream.received`), so we need to create an event listener and add it to our services file:

`CoreBundle\EventHandler\RequestEventHandler`:
```
<?php

namespace Acme\CoreBundle\EventHandler;

class RequestEventHandler
{
    
    public $_container;
    
    public function __construct($container)
    {
        $this->_container = $container;
    }

    public function processTweet($request_event)
    {
        $tweet_model = $request_event->getTweet();
        // tweet id
        echo $tweet_model->get('id');
        // user screen name
        echo $tweet_model->get('user')->get('screen_name')
    }
}
```

**Note:** If you want to see all the available parameters, see this [here](https://gist.github.com/scripter-co/6905227).

Now, we just need to add the event listener to the services file, I'm (using yaml):

```
acme_core.twitter.event:
    class: Acme\CoreBundle\EventHandler\RequestEventHandler
    arguments: [@service_container]
    tags:
        - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: scripterco_twitter_stream.received, method: processTweet }
```

That's it, you can easily add in saving of the tweets to a database as the `container` is available within your event handler.
